## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 8 or higher installed
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or a text editor
- Basic understanding of Java syntax

### Running the Examples

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tinyu01/java-chained-conditions.git
   cd java-chained-conditions
   ```

2. Compile and run any example using the command line:
   ```bash
   javac src/basic/SimpleIfElse.java
   java -cp src basic.SimpleIfElse
   ```

   Or simply open the project in your preferred IDE and run the examples from there.

## Learning Path

1. Read the `TUTORIAL.md` in the docs folder for a theoretical introduction
2. Explore the examples in the `basic` directory
3. Move on to the `nested` directory examples
4. Try the practical examples in the `practical` directory
5. Dive into advanced concepts in the `advanced` directory
6. Check out the best practices in `BEST_PRACTICES.md`
7. Test your knowledge with the exercises in `EXERCISES.md`
